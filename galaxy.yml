description: >
  Write/Collects system info from all your hosts into structured CSVs on the control node (via role).
  No Jinja loops, no remote writes. Just clean, centralized facts across 7 categories:
  Hardware, network, storage, users, security, filesystem health, and schedulers.
  Built for audits, reporting, asset tracking, and migrations. Simple, expandable, and
  Made for real-world Linux ops.
  Please note - main role is the key player here
